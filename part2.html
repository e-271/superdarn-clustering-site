        <h4>Validate the predictions [6/11 to 7/09, 4 weeks]</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Research methods of validating radar scatter. Start with how the Bland et. al. method was validated. Also make note of any methods for validating the types of scatter which will be added later, including mixed scatter and meteor scatter.</li>
			<li>Based on that research, write code to test the algorithmâ€™s predictions.</li>
			<li>If problems become apparent from that testing, attempt to debug.</li>
			<li>Produce a report on the results of validation, and update the GitHub repository with the new code and documentation.</li>
