        <h4>Validate the predictions [6/11 to 7/09, 4 weeks]</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Research methods of validating radar scatter. Start with how the Bland et. al. method was validated. Also make note of any methods for validating the types of scatter which will be added later, including mixed scatter and meteor scatter.</li>
			<li>Based on that research, write code to test the algorithmâ€™s predictions.</li>
			<li>If problems become apparent from that testing, attempt to debug.</li>
			<li>Produce a report on the results of validation, and update the GitHub repository with the new code and documentation.</li>

        <h4>Work Log</h4>
		<p>Grid-based DBSCAN: 
I implemented and debugged the Grid-based DBSCAN algorithm based on Kellner et al. My version also has an epsilon value for time, so it considers temporal aspects unlike the Kellner algorithm. It seems to work pretty well, but it's really slow compared to sklearn's regular DBSCAN, too slow to be practical for more than 2-4h data. I've been looking at their code, and am thinking about adapting it to this algorithm. I think their method is O(n) or O(nlog(n)) processor but O(n^2) memory, where mine is O(n^2) processor with small memory footprint. Next week I might work on adapting their code to this algorithm to improve performance.
