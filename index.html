      <h2>Using machine learning to improve SuperDARN data classification</h2>
      <p>This project aims to develop a new approach of classifying SuperDARN (Super Dual Auroral Radar Network) data using machine learning algorithms. In the past, this data has been classified using a formula based on elevation angle, which is not always reliably available, or using another formula based on doppler velocity and spectral width which is biased to miscategorize low-velocity ionospheric backscatter (IS) as ground scatter (GS). Recently, researchers successfully applied machine learning techniques to this data. These approaches improved on past methods, but they used a very limited set of features and relied on simple machine learning methods that do not easily capture non-linear relationships or subtle probability distributions. This project will apply machine learning methods with a focus on using a larger number of well-selected features and using more nuanced algorithms. At the end of the summer, I will deliver a GitHub toolkit with the machine learning tools, a set-up and usage guide, a report on accuracy and validation, and an online graphing tool on the SuperDARN website.</p>
